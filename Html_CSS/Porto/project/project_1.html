                    <h2>WiFi-Based Antenna Rotator Prototype</h2> 
                    <br><br>
                    <p>During my internship at Telkomsel, I worked as a Software and Hardware Developer, where I was involved in the development of embedded systems and wireless control solutions for telecommunication infrastructure. This role allowed me to combine software development, hardware integration, and system testing in a real operational environment, particularly focusing on improving efficiency and safety for field technicians.</p>
                    <p>One of the main projects I worked on was a wireless antenna direction control system designed to enable technicians to adjust antenna orientation remotely without the need to climb communication towers. The system utilized a NodeMCU microcontroller with built-in WiFi, allowing stable wireless communication between the control interface and the antenna movement mechanism. This approach significantly improved operational safety and simplified antenna adjustment procedures.</p>

                         <p>The control system was implemented through an embedded web-based interface hosted directly on the NodeMCU. Users could connect to the device via its internal WiFi hotspot by entering a valid ID and password, then access the control panel through a local web server at http://192.168.4.1/. The interface displayed five vertically arranged control buttons, each representing a predefined antenna rotation angle. Users could easily select the desired rotation, where negative values rotated the antenna counterclockwise and positive values rotated it clockwise.</p>

                    <p>For the mechanical movement, the system employed a NEMA 17 stepper motor as the antenna actuator. The motor demonstrated high precision and responsiveness during testing, accurately positioning the antenna according to the issued commands. With a configuration of 200 steps per revolution and a 3:1 gear ratio, the system was capable of fine-grained rotational control with minimal error. This configuration ensured reliable and precise antenna alignment, supporting optimal signal distribution performance.</p>
                    <p>Overall, this project highlights my experience in embedded systems development, wireless communication, motor control, and full-stack integration between hardware and software. It also reflects my ability to design practical engineering solutions that address real-world challenges in the telecommunications field.</p>
