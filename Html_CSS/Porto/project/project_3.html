                    <h2>Village SMEs Digital Branding Website</h2> 
                    <br><br>

                    <p>This project focused on developing a digital branding website for a village-based Small and Medium Enterprise (SME), specifically Narto Jati Furniture, a teak furniture business located in Sumberkramat Village. The initiative aimed to address the limited market reach of local SMEs that still relied heavily on traditional word-of-mouth promotion and lacked access to digital marketing platforms. Through this project, the website was designed to serve as an online promotional medium that could expand product visibility beyond local boundaries.</p>
                    <p>The project began with an information-gathering phase, which involved direct field visits, interviews, and documentation activities. Interviews were conducted with the business owners to understand their products, production processes, and branding needs. In parallel, product and production images were collected over several days to ensure accurate and representative visual content, considering that furniture production activities varied daily. This phase provided comprehensive data to support effective website content development.</p>

                    </div> -->

                    <p>The implementation phase focused on the technical development of the website. Hosting and domain services were configured using a third-party platform, followed by the selection of a suitable domain name. The website was built using WordPress to simplify content management and ensure long-term usability for the SME. Security was enhanced through SSL installation to enable secure HTTPS communication. A promotional-oriented theme was selected and customized to align with the identity of a teak furniture business, integrating collected text, images, and product information into a clean and user-friendly interface.</p>
                    <p>The website successfully functioned as a digital branding tool and demonstrated measurable impact. Analytics data showed that the website attracted visitors from multiple countries, including the United States, India, and Indonesia, highlighting its ability to reach a global audience without physical marketing efforts. This result confirmed that digital platforms can significantly enhance market exposure for rural SMEs when implemented effectively.</p>
                    <p>Overall, this project demonstrates practical experience in web development, digital branding, stakeholder collaboration, and community-based technology implementation. It highlights how technical solutions can be applied to real social and economic challenges, empowering local businesses through accessible digital technology and sustainable online presence.</p>
